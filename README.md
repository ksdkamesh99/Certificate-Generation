## 📌 Introduction
Automatic Certificate Generation using opencv.
## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
As a Student of National Institute of Technology Patna , I usually participate in tech fest every year and at last I used to get Certificate of participation at end. I wondered how they 
automatically generate certificates for everyone for vast events each.So I thought to implement of my own by taking my certificate and edited it and generated the certificates using
python and opencv
